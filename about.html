    <!-- Paragraphs about why period poverty should be eliminated -->
    <p class="aboutPara">My name is Lily Glewan and I created this website to reach an audience of people who may not have heard of period poverty before in hopes that they learn something new about period poverty and understanding how important it is to eradicate completely. I knew that out of all of the potential social justice issues I could have talked about, period poverty was one that does not get a lot of attention.</p>
    <p class="aboutPara">It's also important to note that period poverty DOES NOT only limit itself to those who menstruate. People who do not have access to a safe and private bathroom, as well as those who do not have clean hygiene products also fall under period poverty. Eliminating period poverty would mean creating a safer place for those to practice their human rights to not only feel safe when using a bathroom privately, but also ensure they do not have to worry about deciding whether to buy menstrual/hygiene products or use harmful alternatives (plastic bags, newspapers, etc.).</p>
